About Me
--------
<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
I am a new MSc. student at the LISA lab. Prior to this I was a research engineer
at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in the Signal Exploitation and
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->
Geolocation division. I am also "everything but thesis" in a MSc.EE, Digital
Signal Processing from University of Texas - San Antonio.

In 2010 I graduated with a BSc.EE, Network and Communications Theory
from Texas State Univerity.

I do a wide variety of software development, mostly in Python and C, including
work on [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org),
[pylearn2](http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/), and
[my own projects](https://github.com/kastnerkyle).
