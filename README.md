To generate the website, it is necessary to clone my pelican-plugins 
and pelican-themes forks. In addition, you will also need:

pip install pelican
pip install markdown
sudo apt-get install pandoc

With this, it should be possible to regenerate my website, found at
http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~kastner/

The only additional thing to do before uploading to UMontreal site is to
change permissions of all files in output/ directory to 777
